Class Materials
----
There is no required textbook for this course. We will make use of numerous online resources including:

- https://developer.android.com/index.html
- https://developer.android.com/courses

- `Android Studio 4.0 Development Essentials <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/professional-android-4th/9781118949528/>`_

Students will need the following resources:

- A computer w/ `Android Studio 4.x <https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html>`_ installed
- A Google Play developer account ($25 one-time fee) 
- A `github.com <https://github.com>`_ account

Class Structure & Topics
----
Each week students will have assigned reading, tutorials or video lectures, as well as Thursday lectures covering the following topics, although sequence and precise list is subject to revision:

- Mobile development overview
- The Android development ecosystem 
- Android activities & intents
- UI Layouts, components, & event handling
- Android testing & debugging
- Dependency management
- Menus & navigation UI
- Asynchronous tasks & web services
- Data storage & content providers
- Application deployment

Grading
----
Grades will be based on regular assignments (80%) and quizzes (20%).

Coding assignments will be posted on Canvas each Tuesday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week.

Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Thursday, and late assignments may be automatically marked down by 10%.

Students will publish completed assignments to their github.com repository and submit the repo link in Canvas. Successful submissions will build in Android Studio and run on the Android emulator or a mobile device without errors.

You may discuss how to approach tasks with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
